                      From March 2020, Australiaâ€™s federal, state and territory governments introduced a variety of measures to slow the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19). These measures had a subsequent impact on the level of crime recorded by state and territory police during the 2020 reference period.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      Property crime decreased across all states and territories during 2020, with the largest falls observed nationally between the March and June quarters, when COVID-19 measures first came into effect.
